# MaxiFilm (BETA)

MaxiFilm is a BETA application in JAVAFX and Material Design, very simple and easy to use for:   
  - Rename Files and WebSeries under a specific format   
  - Remove track number on musics   
  
  
## FRONT-END

You can use it directly with the GUI available in the following folder: /front/build/front-X.X.X-SNAPCHOT.jar


## CLIENT

You can use the MAxiFilm in command line available in the following folder: /client/build/client-X.X.X-SNAPCHOT.jar
Example: "java -jar /path/client.jar /path/folder/to/analyze -s /path/settings/file -f"
-s => Path of the settings.json file
-f => Force (YES) to rename files auto, without interactive mode with prompt to ask NO or YES

Example 2: "java -jar /path/client.jar /path/folder/to/analyze"

## HELP

Any contribution is welcome.
This application is inspired and fully refactored from a private project of @maxime1992
